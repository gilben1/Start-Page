# Start-Page
My firefox start-page. I've removed sensitive URLs, however the general layout is the same.

# Usage
Check [/r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/) to find out how to use it with your specific browser.

# Javascript Shell (sorta)

Keybinds can be set in the variables at the head of `keypress.js`

Default keybinds
- `Escape` => open/close shell
- `Enter` => activate command
- `Right arrow` => tab complete right
- 'Left Arrow` => tab complete left
- `Backspace` => delete a character

`==` points to exact matches from the keyword entered (f ==> foo)
`~=` points to substring matches from the keyword entered (f ==> ofo)
